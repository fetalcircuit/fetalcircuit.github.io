# VGA Reader

I am Editor-in-Chief of the Video Game Art (VGA) Reader, a peer-reviewed journal for video game audiences and video game practitioners interested in the history, theory, and criticism of video games, explored through the lens of art history and visual culture. Its primary aim is to facilitate conversation and exploration of video game art, documenting and disseminating discourse about the far-reaching influence of video games on history, society, and culture.

Through a partnership with Amherst College Press [all of our past issues are available, open-access](https://www.fulcrum.org/amherst?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=Video+Game+Art+Reader&locale=en).

We are always looking for scholarly explorations of games as art, from academics, scholars, and researchers to developers and gamers. Reach out to [tfunk@vgagallery.org](mailto:tfunk@vgagallery.org) with pitches and questions.
