I was invited by Alex Estorick to share my thoughts for a Frieze article, <a href="https://frieze.com/article/wetware-tilt-brush-how-artists-tested-limits-technology-2010s">"From Wetware to Tilt Brush, How Artists Tested the Limits of Technology in the 2010s,"</a> appraising the impact of new tools and platforms over the last decade. The article also features writing by artists, theorists, and curators CÃ©cile B. Evans, Jenna Sutela, Jonathan Yeo, Luba Elliott and Anna Ridler.<br /><br />
