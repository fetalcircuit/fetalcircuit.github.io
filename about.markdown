<em>Tiffany Funk</em> (PhD) is an artist, critical theorist, and researcher specializing in emerging media, computer art, video games, and performance art practices.
<br /><br />
She researches and develops work exploring both current and historical digital technological art practices, alternately taking the form of critical and conceptual writing, drawing, software, video, and installation. These works interrogate the human-prosthetic relationship with technology, focusing on the disruptions and distortions in socio-cultural mis/understandings of computer programming as interactive performance.
<br /><br />
Her current research delves into the role early computational performances play in both conceptual art practices and the development of human-computer relations in the latter half of the 20th century.
<br /><br />
She has contributed chapters to anthologies concerning activist, intermedia artworks pushing the boundaries of digital art practices, and published interviews and essays in academic journals Antennae and Leonardo Music Journal.
<br /><br />
Funk is the founder and Editor-in-Chief of the Video Game Art Reader, a peer-reviewed journal for video game audiences and video game practitioners interested in the history, theory, and criticism of video games, explored through the lens of art history and visual culture. Its primary aim is to facilitate conversation and exploration of video game art, documenting and disseminating discourse about the far-reaching influence of video games on history, society, and culture.
<br /><br />
She is Co-founding Instructor and Academic Advisor of IDEAS (Interdisciplinary Education in the Arts)â€”an intermedia, theory, and practice-based Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
