<meta name="description" content="The Chapter “Dirty your Media: Artists’ Experiments in Bio-Sovereignty” is now published in The Aesthetics of Necropolitics, a volume edited by Natasha Lushetich. It is part of the series Experiments/On the Political, published by Rowman and Littlefield International. Abstract: “Even before the Snowden leaks, many artists and activists working in the abstraction, encryption, destruction, and obfuscation of data recognized the profound connections between surveillance, privacy, and autonomy. The exploitation of personal data is an exceptionally invasive form of necropower, in which psychopolitical methods subjugate bodies and minds through algorithmic methods that transform all aspects of identity into emotional capital. Those recognizing the pervasive and malicious methods used in gathering our personal information practice data resistance by dirtying their media: subverting, disrupting, camouflaging, and destroying data to evade or expose the algorithms involved in datamining. The aesthetic of these radical forms of digital bio-sovereignty trace a path from the low-fi and lossy to the bent and broken, obfuscating, glitching, jamming, and annihilating data in a new kind of radical social practice.”" />
