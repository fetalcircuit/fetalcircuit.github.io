&lt;span class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;The Chapter &lt;b&gt;“Dirty your Media: Artists’ Experiments in Bio-Sovereignty”&lt;/b&gt; is now published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rowmaninternational.com/book/the_aesthetics_of_necropolitics/3-156-ca075b63-47e4-4ff7-abfa-024766487a88&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aesthetics of Necropolitics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a volume edited by Natasha Lushetich. It is part of the series Experiments/On the Political, published by Rowman and Littlefield International.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Abstract: “Even before the Snowden leaks, many artists and activists working in the abstraction, encryption, destruction, and obfuscation of data recognized the profound connections between surveillance, privacy, and autonomy. The exploitation of personal data is an exceptionally invasive form of necropower, in which psychopolitical methods subjugate bodies and minds through algorithmic methods that transform all aspects of identity into emotional capital. Those recognizing the pervasive and malicious methods used in gathering our personal information practice data resistance by dirtying their media: subverting, disrupting, camouflaging, and destroying data to evade or expose the algorithms involved in datamining. The aesthetic of these radical forms of digital bio-sovereignty trace a path from the low-fi and lossy to the bent and broken, obfuscating, glitching, jamming, and annihilating data in a new kind of radical social practice.”

Hiller Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1956, Lejaren A. Hiller, Jr., and Leonard Isaacson debuted the Illiac Suite, the first score composed with a computer. Its reception anticipated Hiller’s embattled career as an experimental composer. Though the Suite is an influential work of modern electronic music, Hiller’s accomplishment in computational experimentation is above all an impressive feat of postwar conceptual performance art. A reexamination of theoretical and methodological processes resulting in the Illiac Suite reveals a conceptual and performative emphasis reflecting larger trends in the experimental visual arts of the 1950s and 1960s, illuminating his eventual collaborations with John Cage and establishing his legacy in digital art practices.

&lt;figcaption&gt;IT’S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE! TAKE THIS. — Old Man, The Legend of Zelda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In an era of ecological, social, and political crisis, when contemporary media inundates
us daily with apocalyptic scenarios, video games can act as a valuable means of
psychological escape. However, video games— as unique, participatory works of art—
can also model both individual and collaborative means of survival through the
experience of play. Video games offer opportunities to navigate both historical and
fictional conflicts, traverse landscapes devastated by climate change or nuclear
holocaust, and manage the limited resources of individuals, or even whole civilizations,
on earth and beyond. They offer players a dizzying array of dystopian scenarios in
which to build and invent, cooperate to achieve shared goals, or sometimes merely
learn how to survive another day. Video games focus attention, hone visuospatial skills,
and shape cognitive control and physical reflexes. How do video games, through these
unique methods, participate in the larger context of radical, activist artworks that
challenge destructive norms and structures of power? How can we harness the skills we
develop through play— or “game the system”— to imagine our best possible future(s) in
trying times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;mark&gt;VGA Reader (VGAR)&lt;/mark&gt; is accepting submissions that critically analyze video game
art as a means of survival. Though “survival strategy” exists as a defined gaming genre,
all video games can be considered as methods of human conditioning, coping, and
creating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;
Possible topics include but are not limited to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ytext&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How video game artworks' development, design, and play are uniquely situated to
explore personal, social, or ecological crises.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How video games participate in larger activist and radical art
communities/collectives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How video game art prototypes collaborative approaches to survival.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How video games explore the long-term implications of human activity in relation
to ecological crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the history of games engages with dystopias and utopias themes of the past
and present.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How video games provide methods of constructive and collaborative play.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How we might develop a critical discourse of “casual” games through
psychological and physiological conditioning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How might we investigate the relationship between survivalist subcultures and
resource management games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How video games can work as systems for mediating or mollifying conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the economies and cultures of world simulators and Massively Multiplayer
Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) can be viewed as models of real-world
growth or collapse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How video games create, reflect, or critique current apocalyptic real world
tragedies, crises, and political upheaval, as well as the media narratives that
surround them.&lt;/li&gt;
