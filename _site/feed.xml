I was invited by Alex Estorick to share my thoughts for a Frieze article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://frieze.com/article/wetware-tilt-brush-how-artists-tested-limits-technology-2010s&quot;&gt;&quot;From Wetware to Tilt Brush, How Artists Tested the Limits of Technology in the 2010s,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; appraising the impact of new tools and platforms over the last decade. The article also features writing by artists, theorists, and curators Cécile B. Evans, Jenna Sutela, Jonathan Yeo, Luba Elliott and Anna Ridler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.videogameartgallery.com/vga-reader&quot;&gt;VGA Reader&lt;/a&gt; is a peer-reviewed journal for video game audiences and video game practitioners interested in the history, theory, and criticism of video games, explored through the lens of art history and visual culture. Its primary aim is to facilitate conversation and exploration of video game art, documenting and disseminating discourse about the far-reaching influence of video games on history, society, and culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;The Chapter &lt;b&gt;“Dirty your Media: Artists’ Experiments in Bio-Sovereignty”&lt;/b&gt; is now published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rowmaninternational.com/book/the_aesthetics_of_necropolitics/3-156-ca075b63-47e4-4ff7-abfa-024766487a88&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aesthetics of Necropolitics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a volume edited by Natasha Lushetich. It is part of the series Experiments/On the Political, published by Rowman and Littlefield International.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Abstract: “Even before the Snowden leaks, many artists and activists working in the abstraction, encryption, destruction, and obfuscation of data recognized the profound connections between surveillance, privacy, and autonomy. The exploitation of personal data is an exceptionally invasive form of necropower, in which psychopolitical methods subjugate bodies and minds through algorithmic methods that transform all aspects of identity into emotional capital. Those recognizing the pervasive and malicious methods used in gathering our personal information practice data resistance by dirtying their media: subverting, disrupting, camouflaging, and destroying data to evade or expose the algorithms involved in datamining. The aesthetic of these radical forms of digital bio-sovereignty trace a path from the low-fi and lossy to the bent and broken, obfuscating, glitching, jamming, and annihilating data in a new kind of radical social practice.”

Hiller Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1956, Lejaren A. Hiller, Jr., and Leonard Isaacson debuted the Illiac Suite, the first score composed with a computer. Its reception anticipated Hiller’s embattled career as an experimental composer. Though the Suite is an influential work of modern electronic music, Hiller’s accomplishment in computational experimentation is above all an impressive feat of postwar conceptual performance art. A reexamination of theoretical and methodological processes resulting in the Illiac Suite reveals a conceptual and performative emphasis reflecting larger trends in the experimental visual arts of the 1950s and 1960s, illuminating his eventual collaborations with John Cage and establishing his legacy in digital art practices.
